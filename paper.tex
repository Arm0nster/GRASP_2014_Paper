\begin{abstract}
    Most virtual reality systems generally fall into one of two categories:
    graphics oriented - which focus on developing immersive environments but
    generally fail to provide users with a strong sense of interactity - and
    haptics oriented - which focus on constructing tools for touch-based
    manipulation and auditory interaction but tend to be very specialized
    applications and tightly bound device ecosystems. We present our approach
    to creating immersive graphical settings with a high degree of interactive
    manipulation using any number of haptic devices.

\section{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Rahul Mangharam for generously providing many of the
resources necessary for building the system. I would especially like to thank
my advisor Professor Camillo Jose Taylor and my graduate student mentor
Anthony Cowley for their tutelage. Finally, I would like extend special thanks
to Professor Katherine Kuchenbecker and Professor Max Mintz for their efforts
to organize the REU program.
