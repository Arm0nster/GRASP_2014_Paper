\begin{abstract}
    Most virtual reality systems generally fall into one of two categories:
    graphics oriented - which focus on developing immersive environments but
    generally fail to provide users with a strong sense of interactivty - and
    haptics oriented - which focus on constructing tools for touch-based
    manipulation and auditory interaction but tend to be very specialized
    applications and tightly bound device ecosystems. We present our approach
    to creating immersive graphical settings with a high degree of interactive
    manipulation using any number of haptic devices.
